Heart Disease Prediction App


This is a Heart Disease Prediction Web Application built using Streamlit. The application allows users to input health data and predicts the likelihood of developing heart disease based on a trained machine learning model.

Features

User Input: Users can enter various health metrics including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, combined in a Voting Classifier for improved accuracy.
Visualizations: Displays prediction results along with relevant visualizations for a better understanding of risk factors.


Technologies Used
Python: The programming language for data processing and model building.
Streamlit: A library for building web applications for machine learning projects.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Matplotlib: For plotting visualizations.
